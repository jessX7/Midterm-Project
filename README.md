# MEDP280 Midterm Project
# Project Overview
- The purpose of this project is to create an interactibe webpage through my knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript.
- The story is about the main character trying to reach a town called Akazukin. Along the way they encounter mysterious things and gain clues to solving the mystery. The key interaction elements are the buttons which lead to different outcomes. The user is also able to turn on/off the music at any given time using the button on the bottom right.

# Figma Design

- I tried to make the design minimal and match the background color and help create an eerie feeling. I made sure that it would look well even with smaller screens and that everything would be centered.

# Features
- Animations: I added keyframes to change the opacity and transform elements.
- Sound Effects: They were used at the beginning of the game. The other sound would be triggered once the user got to a point in the story.
- User Triggered Events: The users could click on the buttons to select a choice and move the story along. When the user hovers over the buttons, there will be a magnifying glass that displays as the cursor.
- Responsive Design: I have made the webpage adapt to desktop and mobile using media queries. The position of the buttons changes as the window changes to mobile to create a more cohesive experience.

# Technologies Used
- Languages: HTML, CSS, Javascript
- Other: GitHub Pages for hosting, Figma for design

# Future Enhancements 
- I would have loved to add more animations such as making the buttons shake to match the atmosphere. It would also have been better if I could added more user-triggered events.
