        <h1>The Road to Akazukin</h1>
        <p>You are traveling through a fog-covered forest on the road to the remote town of Akazukin. The air is thick
            with mist, and shadows dance among the trees. Suddenly, you hear a distant scream echoing through the fog,
            sending chills down your spine.</p>
        <button class="option-button" onclick="goToScene(2)">Investigate the scream</button>
        <button class="option-button" onclick="goToScene(3)">Ignore the scream and continue</button>
    </div>

    <div id="scene-2" class="hidden">
        <h1>Investigating the Scream</h1>
        <p>You step off the path, driven by a mix of fear and curiosity, and head toward the source of the scream. As
            you push through the underbrush, you find a womanâ€™s body, her eyes wide open in terror. Clutched in her hand
            is a crumpled letter, stained with something dark.</p>
        <button class="option-button" onclick="goToScene(4)">Take the letter and read it</button>
        <button class="option-button" onclick="goToScene(1)">Leave the body and return to the road</button>
    </div>

    <div id="scene-3" class="hidden">
        <h1>Continuing to Akazukin</h1>
        <p>You decide to ignore the scream and quicken your pace toward Akazukin. As you walk, the sensation of being
            watched intensifies, and your heart races. Suddenly, a shadowy figure appears in the distance, its shape
            flickering like a candle flame.</p>
        <button class="option-button" onclick="goToScene(5)">Confront the figure</button>
        <button class="option-button" onclick="goToScene(6)">Walk faster and head to Akazukin</button>
    </div>

    <div id="scene-4" class="hidden">
        <h1>The Letterâ€™s Warning</h1>
        <p>You take the letter from the womanâ€™s hand. It reads: "Beware of the one who watches from the shadows. Trust
            no one in Akazukin. They are not what they seem." The chilling words linger in your mind, filling you with
            dread.</p>
        <button class="option-button" onclick="goToScene(6)">Continue to Akazukin</button>
    </div>

    <div id="scene-5" class="hidden">
        <h1>Confronting the Figure</h1>
        <p>You shout at the figure, demanding to know who they are, but it vanishes into the fog as suddenly as it
            appeared. A cold hand brushes against your shoulder, causing you to spin around, heart pounding. Yet, no one
            is thereâ€”just the oppressive silence of the forest.</p>
        <button class="option-button" onclick="goToScene(6)">Run to Akazukin</button>
    </div>

    <div id="scene-6" class="hidden">
        <h1>Arriving at Akazukin</h1>
        <p>As you enter the town of Akazukin, an unsettling stillness envelops you. The streets are eerily quiet, and
            the dim glow of a small inn beckons you. As you approach, a chill runs down your spine, and a sense of
            foreboding hangs in the air.</p>
        <button class="option-button" onclick="goToScene(7)">Enter the inn and rest</button>
        <button class="option-button" onclick="goToScene(8)">Explore the town</button>
    </div>

    <div id="scene-7" class="hidden">
        <h1>The Innkeeper's Warning</h1>
        <p>The innkeeper, a gaunt man with sunken eyes, greets you with a wary expression. "You shouldnâ€™t stay here too
            long," he warns in a trembling voice. "People who stay in Akazukin disappear without a trace. The town has
            secrets... dark ones."</p>
        <button class="option-button" onclick="goToScene(8)">Leave the inn and explore</button>
        <button class="option-button" onclick="goToScene(9)">Ignore the warning and rest for the night</button>
    </div>

    <div id="scene-8" class="hidden">
        <h1>Exploring the Town</h1>
        <p>As you wander the desolate streets, you discover old documents hidden in the town hall revealing a dark
            secret: the townspeople are involved in a twisted ritual to summon an ancient entity known as the Shadow
            Warden. It thrives on fear and despair, claiming its victims to grow stronger.</p>
        <button class="option-button" onclick="goToScene(10)">Flee the town immediately</button>
        <button class="option-button" onclick="goToScene(11)">Confront the town leaders</button>
    </div>

    <div id="scene-9" class="hidden">
        <h1>You Vanish</h1>
        <p>You fall asleep, the innkeeper's warning echoing in your mind, but itâ€™s too late. You never wake up, your
            essence claimed by the darkness of Akazukin. Your disappearance becomes another whispered tale in the town's
            grim history.</p>
        <button class="option-button" onclick="goToScene(1)">Start Over</button>
    </div>

    <div id="scene-10" class="hidden">
        <h1>Escaping the Town</h1>
        <p>You sprint through the town's fog-laden streets, adrenaline surging as you narrowly escape the clutches of
            the Shadow Warden. You glance back to see the town shrouded in a dense fog, the screams of the lost echoing
            behind you. Though you may have escaped, the haunting memories will forever linger in your mind.</p>
        <button class="option-button" onclick="goToScene(12)">Find solace in a nearby village</button>
        <button class="option-button" onclick="goToScene(1)">Start Over</button>
    </div>

    <div id="scene-11" class="hidden">
        <h1>Confronting the Leaders</h1>
        <p>You confront the town leaders, but itâ€™s too late. The ritual has already begun, a swirling mass of shadows
            enveloping you. You realize too late that the leaders have long since lost their humanity, becoming vessels
            for the Shadow Warden. Your fate is sealed as darkness engulfs you.</p>
        <button class="option-button" onclick="goToScene(1)">Start Over</button>
    </div>

    <div id="scene-12" class="hidden">
        <h1>A New Beginning</h1>
        <p>You find refuge in a nearby village, where the warm glow of homes and the laughter of children welcome you.
            You share your tale of terror, and the villagers vow to keep the darkness of Akazukin at bay. Though you
            carry the scars of your experience, you realize that your courage has inspired others. You become a
            protector of the innocent, ensuring that no one else falls prey to the Shadow Warden's grasp.</p>
